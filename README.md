Automated Pipeline & Data Trust by Design

## Description

Target of this project is to showcase an automated pipeline using [Data Contracts](https://datacontract.com/), [DLTHub](https://dlthub.com/) and [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/) to feed a data platform and a data catalog.

We'll combine this set of tool and a data platform to automate code generation and quality checks.

## Project structure

1. Data contract (`1.Data_contract/`)
2. Data contract validation & artifacts generation (`2.Validation/`)
3. DDL for catalogs (`4.DDL_for_catalogs/`)
4. DLTHub code for data ingestion (`3.Ingestion/`)
5. Great Expectations code (`5.GX_code/`)
6. Data processing (`6.Data_processing/`)
7. Orchestrator (Dagster) (`7.Orchestrator/`)
