Automated Pipeline &amp; Data Trust by Design

## Description

Target of this project is to showcase an automated pipeline using [https://datacontract.com/](Data Contracts), [https://dlthub.com/](DLTHub) and [https://greatexpectations.io/](Great Expectations) to feed a data platform and a data catalog.

We'll combine this set of tool and a data platform to automate code generation and quality checks. 

## Project structure

1. Data contract 
2. Data contract validation & artifacts generation
3. DDL for catalogs
4. DLTHub code for data ingestion
5. Great Expectations code
6. Data processing
